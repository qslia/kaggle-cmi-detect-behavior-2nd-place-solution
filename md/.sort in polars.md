Ahh — you’re pointing at **`.sort`** 👍
Let’s strip it down and make it *intuitive*.

---

## What is `.sort()` in Polars?

```python
.sort(["orientation", "gesture", "behavior"])
```

It means:

> **Order the rows in a predictable, alphabetical (or numeric) way
> using these columns, from left to right.**

Think of it like sorting a spreadsheet.

---

## How it works (step by step)

Polars sorts **lexicographically**:

1. First by `orientation`
2. If `orientation` is the same → by `gesture`
3. If both are the same → by `behavior`

### Example (before sort)

| orientation | gesture | behavior |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- |
| left        | swipe   | fast     |
| right       | tap     | slow     |
| left        | tap     | slow     |
| left        | tap     | fast     |

---

### After `.sort(["orientation", "gesture", "behavior"])`

| orientation | gesture | behavior |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- |
| left        | swipe   | fast     |
| left        | tap     | fast     |
| left        | tap     | slow     |
| right       | tap     | slow     |

## Why this matters in **your code**

You later do:

```python
for i, (...) in enumerate(...):
    label2idx[...] = i
```

If you **don’t sort**, then:

* The order depends on:

  * data ingestion
  * hashing
  * execution plan
* Labels may change between runs ❌

With `.sort(...)`:

✅ Same data → same label numbers
✅ Reproducible training
✅ Stable class indices

This is *crucial* for ML.

---

## Mental model (easy to remember)

> `.unique()` decides **what exists**
> `.sort()` decides **in what order you number them**

---

## One-line intuition

> **`.sort()` makes your label IDs deterministic.**

That’s it.

If you want, next I can explain:

* why `.unique()` alone is dangerous
* how `.sort()` differs from SQL ORDER BY
* or how to sort descending / custom order
